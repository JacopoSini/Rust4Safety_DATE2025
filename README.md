# Rust4Safety

This repository contains the source code example for implementing the Control Flow Checking algorithms YACCA and RACFED in the Rust language.

It is composed of three folders:
 - **Vanilla** contains the application without any hardening
 - **YACCA** contains the application hardened with the Yet Another Control-Flow Checking using Assertions algorithm
 - **RACFED** contains the application hardened with the Random Additive Control Flow Error Detection algorithm.
 - **ExperimentalResults** contains the Excel files with the detailed results obtained from the six campaigns
